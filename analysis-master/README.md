**June 9, 2020: Analysis Team Meeting**
- Went over how to use Github and Markdown 

## Organizational Logistics
- Review existing content
- Set up time for Sarah and Matt to work as a pair
--> Work Wed 6/10 to generate ideas together 
- Set up time for Joanne, Sarah, and Matt to touch base
--> Let Joanne know when we are ready to meet with her after our work session 
--> Monday's generally work for Joanne
- Full team meeting towards the end of the week of 6/15

## Biggest Challenges
- Formal definitions of Big O etc. are not intuitive in their formal explanations
- Reduce the lecture time
- Figuring out what is good to keep/be added on 
- Making it so that it's not so many dense slides in a row
- Don't have one big worksheet; instead, have many "think-pair-share" activities to digest material as it's being introduced
- Focus on the content, not the formatting

## Matt making sure he can use Git :)
- No updates here, just making sure I can edit, push, etc.

**June 10, 2020: Sarah and Matt Work Meeting**
- Went over slides #1 
--> Made clarifying statements and included new examples
- Went over slides #2 
- Went over worksheet
--> Added a problem to the worksheet
--> Decided where each worksheet problem fit into the lecture


**Meeting with Joanne and entire analysis team to go over review notes**
- Episode 0  
--> For the explanations regarding counting steps, have the teacher do the processes and multiplying out on the board  
--> Clarify that the indexOf() method requires a linear search that traverses through the string. This will clarify the explanation.  
- Episode 1  
--> Maybe we can categorize each of the questions into either "basic/normal" versus "more difficult/think harder" so that students will know which questions to use in what order when reviewing the material. 
- Episode 2   
--> Markdown technicality issues to be resolved.  
- Episode 3  
--> Good to do the same question twice. This makes people more engaged especially the second time they answer the question. It is a good way to gauge where the students are at in understanding. 
- Are the learning outcomes met?  
--> Disha and Ese to meet right after meeting to make sure that all of the learning outcomes are addressed either in the activities or in the homework.
