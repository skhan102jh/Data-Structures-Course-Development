# Topics/Sub-topics

- Review: BST
- Coding exercise (Homework clinic: BST)
  - `Node` class
  - `find` (Binary Search)
  - recursive `insert`
  - recursive `remove` 
- BBST: Balanced BST
  - Review: BST best case when the height is O(log N)
  - Balance property
  - Balance factor
  - Height of BBST is O(log N)


# Learning Outcomes

- Identify the height and balance factor of binary search tree nodes
- Differentiate binary trees, binary search trees and balanced binary search trees based on the structure (balance) and ordering properties
- Understand the use of helper methods for implementing recursive approaches
- Analyze the time/space efficiency of BBST implementation approach
