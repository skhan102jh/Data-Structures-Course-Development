# Topics/Sub-topics

* Review: BBST
* Operations (`find`, `insert`, `remove`) 
* Rotations
  * Singles (right or left)
  * Doubles (left-right or right-left)
  * How to decide which rotation to apply?
* Runtime (core operations)
  * **Guaranteed** O(log N) 

# Learning Outcomes
* Explain and trace the balancing operations of an AVL tree
* Select the appropriate rotation type in order to rebalance an AVL tree after an operation (`insert`, `remove`) is performed
* Implement the core operations of an OrderedMap efficiently with an AVL tree
* Analyze the time/space efficiency of an AVL tree implementation approach for a Map
* Use AVL implementation of an OrderedMap to solve a computational problem 
* _Select appropriate data structure(s) for a given problem_
