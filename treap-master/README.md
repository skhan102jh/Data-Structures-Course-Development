# Topics/Sub-topics

* BST (on keys) + Heap (on priorities) = Treap!
* Operations (`find`, `insert`, `remove`) 
* Rotations (Single right/left)
* Runtime (core operations)
  * Worst-case O(N)
  * Expected O(log N)

# Learning Outcomes
* Explain and trace the balancing operations of a Treap
* Explain the role of the priorities in rebalancing and the importance of being random
* Select the appropriate rotation type in order to rebalance a Treap after an operation (insert, remove) is performed
* Implement the core operations of an OrderedMap efficiently with a Treap
* Analyze the time/space efficiency of a Treap implementation approach for a Map
* Differentiate between worst-case efficiency, amortized efficiency and probabilistic/expected efficiency 
* Use Treap implementation of an OrderedMap to solve a computational problem 
* Conduct a performance analysis on unbalanced BST, AVL, and Treap implementations of a OrderedMap when applied to a particular computing problem
* _Select appropriate data structure(s) for a given problem_
